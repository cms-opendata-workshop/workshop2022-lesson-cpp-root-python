<img src="assets/img/cpp_and_root_logo.png" alt="C++ and ROOT pre-exercise logo" width="50%">

These pre-exercises are designed to prepare you for using C++ and ROOT, in a very specific
context: editing and running much of the pre-existing code used to access
some of the older open data files.
This is *not* a full introduction to either C++ or ROOT, however
we do take time to explain some key concepts that will help you feel more comfortably working
with the open data codebase.

You should definitely take time to go through either this exercise before
participating in the workshop.

If you run into problems with any of these steps, please reach out to the organizers
through the dedicated [Mattermost channel][mattermost].
